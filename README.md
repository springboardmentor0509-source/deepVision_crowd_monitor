DeepVision Crowd Monitor
AI System for Real-Time Crowd Density Estimation, Overcrowding Detection & Visual Analytics

DeepVision Crowd Monitor is an end-to-end AI platform designed to estimate crowd density, detect overcrowded regions, and visualize density maps using deep learning models and live video analysis.

Built for real-world safety applications such as:

Railway & Metro Stations
